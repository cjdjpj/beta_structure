# Bursts of reproduction can create genetic structure in bacterial populations

Coalescent simulations in msprime.

Can bursts of reproduction introduce genetic structure into highly recombinogenic bacterial populations? (i.e. could they explain the presence of strain structure in species that have high recombination rates)
How do bursts of reproduction affect the population's patterns of diversity? 
Can we detect these bursts?
